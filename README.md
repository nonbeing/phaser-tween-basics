# phaser-tween-basics

Simple combination of a couple of basic phaser tutorials:

1. Tweening: http://phaser.io/examples/v2/basics/07-tween-an-image
1. Render Text: http://phaser.io/examples/v2/basics/06-render-text

The challenge was to run (1) followed by (2) in sequence. 
This needed a bit of work and finally found the solution in maintaining a global flag indicating what state the game is in.
Got this idea from the Shootout Example (https://phaser.io/tutorials/coding-tips-006) which maintains a lot of states and is much more complicated.
